# U.S. County Population Study

This is a study of population growth of U.S. counties between 2010 and 2016.
The data is taken from ers.usda.gov. The ultimate goal of the study is to use
machine learning to predict whether a particular county's population will
increase or decrease over the period 2010-2016, based on features like
income, education, and rural/urban classification.
